  <p><span class="dropcap02">A</span> place</br>
burned behind my</br>
lids, white spectral sun</br>
enveloping, softly, lapped like</br>
fresh milk</p>

<p>by my</br>
clear and greedy</br>
eyes guilty and forever longing</br>
curious</p>

<p>pressed gently into my warm palms</br>
a tender object, a sensitive brush of fingers on electric skin but</br>
(Oh)</br>
it'll still be there, blooming,</br>
crashing out of memory like white foam- lilies of vivid stone when</br>
I get back, when I open (them) again and again and again</br>
like new wings, not delicate but strong</p>

<p>it's that feeling that it wasn't just a dream after all</br>
I was truly open-opening, unfolding, unsealed</br>
I dreamt of the things</br>
I can do now</br>
I wanted them, they smoldered like coals,</br>
flickered like insect wings caught in my hands,</br>
crushed in desperate, nervous fingers, sticky</br>
those desires, they were</br>
bitten between dry lips, and held between quick breath,</br>
pulled between snarled hair, flattened beneath restless feet,</br>
twisted into swirling tingling knots deep in my cramped belly</p>

<p>but my eyes flickered, flicked stung</br>
open, my fingers unfolded, fluttered</br>
something unfurled and stretched out, danced</p>

<p>it is, it is not, a romantic notion because everything is</br>
wide, wide, wide open!</br>
little past, small and hopeful, come to the future with me,</br>
I have cracked its thin shell.</br>
